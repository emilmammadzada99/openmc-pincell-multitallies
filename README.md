Multi-tally (mesh + energy) simulation, analysis and visualization of neutron spectrum variations  in a PWR fuel pin model using OpenMC.
# OpenMC Pincell Multi-Tallies Neutron Spectrum Variations

This project performs neutron spectrum analysis and visualization for a **PWR fuel pin** using **multiple tallies** in [OpenMC](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/).  
The simulation collects and compares flux distributions, reaction rates, and spectral variations across energy groups and spatial regions.

## Features
- Multi-tally setup (mesh + energy tallies)
- Neutron spectrum analysis in fuel and moderator regions
- Visualization of spectrum variations using Matplotlib
- Modular and reproducible OpenMC workflow

## Requirements
- Python â‰¥ 3.8  
- OpenMC â‰¥ 0.14.0  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, h5py
